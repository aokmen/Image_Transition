# Description:
---
* This code is an HTML document that includes some CSS styles and JavaScript functions. It defines a webpage with a container div that has two headings: "The Most Beautiful Landscapes" and "Nice With You". There is also a footer div that contains three child divs with class div1.
---
* The CSS styles define some common styles for all elements in the page, such as the font family and text alignment. The container class styles the container div and sets a top margin of 400 pixels. The body class sets a background image for the page, with some additional styles to make it cover the full height of the viewport and transition smoothly when changing between images. The h1 and h2 classes style the headings, with large font sizes, bold weights, and text shadows to create an attractive effect. The footer class styles the footer div, centering it horizontally and setting a top margin of 300 pixels. The div1 class styles the child divs within the footer, with a fixed height and width, a background color, and a border radius to create rounded corners. When hovered over, the div1 elements change their background color and add a box shadow to create an interactive effect.
---
* The JavaScript functions define what happens when the user hovers over each of the div1 elements in the footer. When the first div is hovered over, the title1 heading changes its color to dark green, the title2 heading changes its color to dark cyan, and the body background image changes to a camping scene. When the second div is hovered over, the colors of the headings swap, with title1 becoming dark cyan and title2 becoming dark green, and the body background image changes to a rocky landscape. When the third div is hovered over, the colors of the headings change again, with title1 becoming dark red and title2 becoming coral, and the body background image changes to a tree-filled scene.
